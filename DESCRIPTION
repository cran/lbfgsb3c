Description: Interfacing to Nocedal et al. L-BFGS-B.3.0
        (See <http://users.iems.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html>)
        limited memory BFGS minimizer with bounds on parameters.
        This is a fork of 'lbfgsb3'.
	This registers a 'R' compatible 'C' interface to L-BFGS-B.3.0 that uses the same
	function types and optimization as the optim() function (see writing 'R' extensions
        and source for details).  This package also adds more stopping criteria as well
        as allowing the adjustment of more tolerances.
